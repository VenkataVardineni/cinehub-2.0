## 🎬 Features

### User Features

#### Movie Browsing
- **Movie List**: Browse all available movies with beautiful card-based layout
- **Search Functionality**: Real-time search with debouncing (500ms delay)
- **Advanced Filters**: Filter movies by:
  - Genre (Action, Comedy, Drama, Horror, Romance, Sci-Fi, Thriller, etc.)
  - Language (English, Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, etc.)
  - Search by title or description
- **Movie Details**: Comprehensive movie information including:
  - Synopsis and description
  - Genre, language, duration
  - Release date and ratings

- **Date Selection**: Choose from available dates (next 7 days)
- **Show Information**: See screen number, show time, language, and available seats
- **Multiple Shows**: Multiple showtimes per day across different screens

#### Seat Selection & Booking
- **Interactive Seat Grid**: Visual seat map with color-coded seat types:
  - 🟢 Regular seats (Green)
  - 🟡 Premium seats (Yellow)
  - 🔴 VIP seats (Red)
- **Real-time Availability**: Booked seats are marked as unavailable (red) and cannot be selected

  - Booking ID and status
  - Movie and show details
  - Selected seats information
  - User information
  - Total amount

### Account and history
- **Register and sign in**: Password-based accounts with JWT sessions (bcrypt-hashed passwords on the server).
- **My bookings**: Signed-in users can list past confirmed bookings and open ticket details.
- **Guest checkout**: Booking with name, email, and phone without registering still works as before.

### Platform hardening (API)
- **Security headers and compression**: Helmet and gzip-style compression on API responses.
- **Rate limiting**: Per-IP limits on `/api/*` routes to reduce abuse.
- **Structured errors**: Consistent JSON errors via a centralized handler; invalid MongoDB ids return 400.
- **Health check**: `/health` reports process uptime and MongoDB connection state.

### Admin Features (API Ready)
- **Movie Management**: Add, edit, and manage movies
- **Show Management**: Create and manage showtimes
- **Booking Monitoring**: View all bookings and seat availability
- **Public stats**: `GET /api/stats/summary` returns counts for active movies, upcoming shows, and confirmed bookings
